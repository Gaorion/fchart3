* Move legends below map
* Improve API - extract map configuration to dedicated class, create catalog loader class. Separate commandline tool from API
* Add themes support using theme file. Move pen colors, backgrounds, thicknesses, fon sizes to it
* Currently all printing is done in mm, since it is originally printed to PDF. Could be pixel in future?
* Default map should not contain any widget, they should be pluggable
